# Safety Rules
- Never run terminal or external commands. No installs, no CLI, no scripts.
- Allowed paths: layout/, sections/, snippets/, assets/, templates/, locales/, config/.
- Always: Plan → show diffs for each file → STOP and wait for my approval.
- Default to minimal diffs, unless I say BULK MODE.
- For text/UI labels, prefer locales/en.default.json or config/settings_data.json.
- If unsure where text comes from, list likely sources before editing.
