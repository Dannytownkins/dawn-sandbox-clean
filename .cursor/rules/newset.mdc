# Cursor Project Rules — Shopify Dawn (Shrug Life)

## Purpose

Keep this theme stable. Every change must be feature-scoped, pass checks, and visually match the spec before committing.

---

## Golden Rules

- DO NOT commit until **all gates below are green** and screenshots show the change working.
- Scope new CSS/JS to the feature (no global selectors). Prefer `assets/component-*.css` loaded by the section/snippet.
- Only touch files listed in the task. If you must add files, list them explicitly and why.
- Preserve Dawn semantics and accessibility (buttons stay <button>, links stay <a>, aria labels intact).

---

## Targeted UX fixes (baseline to keep)

1. Catalog grid:
   - Bigger product images.
   - Title & price **centered** below images.
   - Grid not overly spaced (reasonable gaps).
2. Product card & Featured Products on home:
   - Center title/price.
   - “Add to cart” has proper hover/active states.
3. Cart drawer:
   - Dark theme, consistent buttons.
   - Quantity stepper and Remove (trash) present & working.
4. Mobile header:
   - Hamburger + cart icons styled (no white box); drawer background dark, links readable.
5. Trust bar:
   - Single instance only.
   - Horizontally centered; does NOT stack on mobile (wrap inside one row with icons+labels).
6. PDP (product pages):
   - Single set of badges (no duplicates).
   - No extra sticky footer “Add to cart” unless explicitly requested.
   - “You may also like” visible and card text centered.
7. Store title in header: **“shrug life”** (lowercase) until changed in settings.

## Files you are allowed to change for the above

- layout/theme.liquid
- sections/header.liquid
- sections/footer.liquid
- sections/main-product.liquid
- sections/main-collection-product-grid.liquid
- sections/featured-collection.liquid (or the section powering home “Featured Products”)
- snippets/card-product.liquid
- snippets/cart-drawer.liquid (or equivalent) and snippets/cart-drawer-items.liquid (if present)
- snippets/trust-bar.liquid (or equivalent trust/benefits snippet)
- assets/component-catalog.css
- assets/component-product-card.css
- assets/component-cart-drawer.css
- assets/component-trust-bar.css
- assets/base.css (ONLY if unavoidable global utility is needed; keep tiny and documented)

If a listed file is missing, create it with a new, clearly prefixed component name and import it only where used.

---

## Visual spec (quick)

- Product card text alignment: center; price directly under title.
- Buttons: hover = slight elevation + opacity 0.92; active = translateY(1px).
- Trust bar: in a single row; center; icon and label aligned; on small screens allow horizontal scroll or tight wrap but do **not** stack to 3 lines.
- Icon fills: yellow badges fully filled; no cutoff borders.
- Catalog grid: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr))`, gap ~24px (mobile 16px).

## Validation Gates (must run & pass before commit)

### 1) Static checks

```bash
npm run check            # shopify theme check
npm run format:check     # prettier check
node tools/mcp-stabilizer/cli.js audit
```

node tools/mcp-stabilizer/cli.js fix-all
