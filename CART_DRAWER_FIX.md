# Cart Drawer Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The cart drawer was showing an error "Could not add to cart. Please try again or contact support." instead of sliding out when adding products to cart.

## Root Cause
There were **two conflicting add-to-cart handlers**:
1. Dawn theme's built-in `product-form.js` (proper system)
2. Custom handler in `assets/cart.js` (conflicting)

Both were trying to intercept the form submission, causing errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed Conflicting Code** ✅
- Removed custom AJAX add-to-cart handler from `assets/cart.js`
- Let Dawn's native `product-form.js` and `cart-drawer.js` handle everything

### 2. **Updated Cart Drawer Structure** ✅
**File:** `snippets/cart-drawer.liquid`
- Replaced custom cart drawer with Dawn's proper `<cart-drawer>` custom element structure
- Full cart items table with proper Dawn styling
- Quantity controls with +/- buttons
- Remove item buttons
- Subtotal and checkout buttons
- Proper ARIA labels and accessibility

### 3. **Fixed Header Cart Button** ✅
**File:** `sections/header.liquid`
- Changed from `<button>` to `<a>` tag
- Added `id="cart-icon-bubble"` (required by Dawn's cart-drawer.js)
- Updated cart count badge to Dawn's expected structure:
  ```liquid
  <div class="cart-count-bubble">
    <span aria-hidden="true">{{ cart.item_count }}</span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">{{ 'sections.header.cart_count' | t: count: cart.item_count }}</span>
  </div>
  ```

### 4. **Created Missing Icon Snippets** ✅
Added 6 icon files that Dawn's cart drawer needs:
- `snippets/icon-close.liquid` - Close X button
- `snippets/icon-minus.liquid` - Decrease quantity
- `snippets/icon-plus.liquid` - Increase quantity
- `snippets/icon-remove.liquid` - Remove item (trash icon)
- `snippets/icon-discount.liquid` - Discount tag icon
- `snippets/icon-caret.liquid` - Dropdown caret

### 5. **Added Missing Locale Translations** ✅
**File:** `locales/en.default.json`
Added to `sections.cart`:
```json
"taxes_included_and_shipping_policy_html": "Tax included. <a href=\"{{ link }}\">Shipping</a> calculated at checkout.",
"taxes_included_but_shipping_at_checkout": "Tax included. Shipping calculated at checkout.",
"taxes_and_shipping_policy_at_checkout_html": "Taxes and <a href=\"{{ link }}\">shipping</a> calculated at checkout.",
"taxes_and_shipping_at_checkout": "Taxes and shipping calculated at checkout."
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Add to Cart"** on product page
2. **Dawn's product-form.js** intercepts the submission
3. **Sends AJAX request** to `/cart/add.js`
4. **On success**, calls `renderContents()` on the cart-drawer element
5. **Cart drawer automatically opens** and displays updated cart
